    "The sensitivity and specificity of a test are useful to give us an idea of how reliable the test is.\n",
    "Often, tests are assessed in isolationg: which test of this set of tests is *most reliable*.\n",
    "This test is then proposed as an archetype/goal.\n",

    "Tests, when taken in combination, provide a much richer picture.\n",
    "In this notebook we'll go through sens/spec of *compound* tests and demonstrate quantitatively that a combination of tests can achieve improved sens/spec than the \"best\" test.\n",
    "We'll then propose a formalised approach to deciding the optimal test combination to achieve a desired predictive performance in the context of *costs* to tests."
